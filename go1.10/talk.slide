Just go [[https://speakerdeck.com/campoy/the-state-of-go-1-dot-10][speakerdeck]]!

* Time flies

Go 1.8 is one year old (Happy Birthday!)

Go 1.9 is already 6 months old!

Go 1.10rc1 was released on January 25th.

Go 1.10 is about 🤞 to be released!

* Notes

The slides are already available on [[https://campoy.cat/l/sog110][campoy.cat/l/sog110]]

Most of the code examples won't run except locally and using Go 1.10.

The playground still runs Go 1.9.

👉 do not send issues about the slides not running correctly online!




* Agenda

Changes since Go 1.9:

- The Language
- The Ports
- The Tooling
- The Standard Library
- The Performance
- The Community




* Changes To The Language

* Ports

* New Ports

* Notes On Existing Ports

- FreeBSD: requires FreeBSD 10.3 or later

- NetBSD: works but requires NetBSD 8 ... which is not released yet

- OpenBSD: next version will require OpenBSD 6.2

- OS X: next version will require OS X 10.10 Yosemite

- Windows: next version will require Windows 7 (no more XP or Vista)

- 32-bits MIPS have now a new GOMIPS variable (*hardfloat* | `softfloat`)

* One More Note On Existing Ports

It's rare that I laugh out loud while reading GitHub issues.

* Changes To The Tooling

* Changes To The Tooling

In two words: easier and faster.

* Easier set-up

`GOPATH` became optional in Go 1.8.

`GOROOT` is now optional too, deduced from the binary path.

A new variable `GOTMPDIR` was added to control where temporary files are created.

* Faster tools via caching

- `go`install` now caches the result of compiled packages.

- `go`install` and `go`build` are *much* faster in general as a result

- you won't need `go`build`-i` anymore!

It seems the `pkg` directory might eventually disappear!

* Testing

Also caches results, everything is faster

    ➜  go test strings
    ok  	strings	(cached)

In order to bypass the cachee use `-count=1`

    ➜  go test -count=1 strings
    ok  	strings	0.295s

Also runs `vet`, some of your tests might fail.

Also:

- `coverprofile` can be done over many tests too
- new `-failfast` and `-json` flags

* A Small Detour

* Three-Index Slicing

Did you know you can use three values for slicing?

.play bytes/slices.go /START/,/END/

* Three-Index Slicing (cont.)

You can control the capacity of the resulting slice.

.play bytes/slices2.go /START/,/END/

* gofmt

Small change in formatting of three-index slicing expressions.

Before:

    a[i : j:k]

Now:

    a[i : j : k]

This might break some of your CI tests (it broke some of mine).




* Changes To The Standard Library

* Changes To The Standard Library

No new packages with Go 1.10

Trivia: Do you remember which new package was added with Go 1.9?


* Changes to bytes

`Fields`, `FieldsFunc`, `Split`, and `SplitAfter` limit the capacity of the returned slices.

.play bytes/fields.go /START/,/END/

.caption [[https://play.golang.org/p/efBt6pBszef][playground]]

* Changes to flags

This is minor, but I am very happy about it!

.play flags/main.go /START/,/END/

Before 😕

    -s int
            some other stuff
    it's long to explain
    -z int
            some number (default 42)

Now 😎

    -s int
            some other stuff
            it's long to explain
    -z int
            some number (default 42)

* Changes to go/doc

For a type T, functions returning slices of `T`, `*T`, or `**T` are now linked to `T`.

Those functions now appear in the `Funcs` list of the type, not the package.

Example:

.code things/things.go

* Changes to go/doc (cont.)

Before 😕

    package things // import "github.com/campoy/talks/go1.10/things"

    func ManyThings() []Thing
    type Thing struct{}
        func NewThing() *Thing

Now 😎

    package things // import "github.com/campoy/talks/go1.10/things"

    type Thing struct{}
        func ManyThings() []Thing
        func NewThing() *Thing

* Changes to text/template

New `{{break}}` and `{{continue}}` for `{{range}}`.

.play template/main.go /var tmpl/,/\)\)/

_Note:_ Interestingly, this is not implemented in the `html` package.

* strings

I'm sure you've written this kind of code before.

.play -edit strings/bytes.go /var buf/,/buf.String/

But there's some issues with it.

`String` creates allocations since it convers `[]byte` to `string`.

There could be a better and simpler way to do this.

.play -edit strings/strings.go /var b/,/b.String/

This uses reflection to avoid copies in the creation of strings.

* strings.Builder 👍

When you're creating many strings, it is definitely worth it.

.code strings/bench_test.go /START/,/END/

    PASS
    ok      github.com/campoy/talks/go1.10/strings  3.626s

* strings.Builder 👎

When you're creating many strings, it is definitely worth it.

	for i := 0; i < 10000; i++ {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "😊")
		// out = w.String()
	}

* Performance Changes

* Runtime Performance

After running all the benchmakrks on the standard library on go1.9.3 vs go1.10rc1:

- nothing changed

    $ benchstat go1.9.txt go1.10.txt  | grep -v "\~"

* Compiler Performance

Compiling the standard library is *10%*faster*!
